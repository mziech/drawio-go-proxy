# drawio-go-proxy

This a small toy project Golang reimplementation of the [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio)
[Java proxy servlet](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/blob/dev/src/main/java/com/mxgraph/online/ProxyServlet.java).

**This project is no way affiliated or endorsed by JGraph / draw.io!
Use at your own risk!**

## Motivation
1. I wanted to have a slim application consuming less resources than a JVM
2. I found it hard to understand the original implementation
3. I wanted to learn a bit of Golang

## Usage

```yml
docker run ghcr.io/mziech/drawio-go-proxy
```
